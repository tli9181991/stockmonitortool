He adds that ""gold can perform well in all three of those,"" pointing out that we are currently in a period of reflation. While right now is a good time to invest in gold since it acts as an inflation hedge, Iaccino warns that when the Federal Reserve starts to fight inflation again, it will be ""too late"" because ""that's when the so-called 'inflation hedge' that a lot of people think gold is starts to expire.""

Daan Struyven, Goldman Sachs co-head of global commodities research, joins Market Domination hosts Julie Hyman and Alexandra Canal to discuss the details. Struyven emphasizes how the shift in central bank behavior stems from Russia's central bank reserves being frozen in 2022. This influenced investments in the US and Europe. ""It was a wake-up call to [emerging-market] EM central bank reserve managers because they realized that their assets would not necessarily be risk-free,"" he explains. ""So they have shifted part of their reserves to buying gold, an asset which cannot be frozen or confiscated."" ""We have seen a five-fold increase in the rhythm of gold purchases by central banks,"" Struyven adds. ""We think this is a structural shift, and we expect ongoing solid above-trend central bank purchases of gold to continue to push gold prices higher."" Additionally, Struyven speaks on lower interest rates and ongoing policy uncertainty contributing to higher demand for gold as a hedge, concluding, ""If policy uncertainty were to remain at high levels ... our model would point to a gold price by year-end of up to $3,300 per troy ounce.""

The Gartman Letter's former editor and publisher and the chairman of the University of Akron’s endowment committee, Dennis Gartman, joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss his market outlook with consideration to equities, commodities, and bonds. ""This morning's CPI number was quite a shock, to be blunt,"" Gartman says, adding, ""We have to remember that January is always a market, a number that tends to be revised rather dramatically, but it's catching everybody off guard this morning, and it's put tremendous pressure on stock prices, tremendous pressure on the bond market and what's interesting is the gold (GC=F) market is falling rather precipitously at the same time."" Gartman tells Yahoo Finance he expects stocks to fall 10% to 15% from recent highs in the next several weeks or months. Taking a look at the bond market, Gartman says he doesn't expect the 10-year Treasury yield to go beyond 4.85%, noting ""the target of 5%, I think, is out of the question as far as I'm concerned.""

Bridgewater Associates' former chief investment strategist Rebecca Patterson joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss worrying signals she's seeing from the bond market. ""Despite the headlines today on tariffs, I think we won't know anything until we actually see the headline that they've been implemented, and even then, I think it's all a question mark,"" Patterson says. A Friday report alleged that the president was considering delaying his tariffs to March 1, which White House officials later refuted. ""To me, the most important thing right now is we now have lived with two weeks of this new world order, which is going to be a lot of intraday and short-term volatility questions around policy. And that matters because, over time, if companies are less certain about what the rules of the road are, they're going to be more cautious about hiring and investment. And if consumers are more cautious, they might slow spending."" Patterson points to these two patterns as potentially weighing on future GDP (gross domestic product): ""So, the uncertainty matters. Not knowing what the rules of the road are going to be from day to day has an effect."" She points to gold prices (GC=F) as proof that the ""volatility... [and] uncertainty is rippling through the markets."" The metal closed at a record high alongside rising bond yields. ""The rise we're seeing in the longer term yields is what they call term premium. It's the extra that investors want to loan the government money for longer,"" she says, tying this rise to policy uncertainty around issues like tariffs and tax cuts.
