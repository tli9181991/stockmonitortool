LONDON - Amundi Physical Metals plc has announced the issuance of a new tranche of exchange-traded commodities (ETC) securities under its Amundi Physical Gold ETC, increasing the total number of securities in the series to 58,351,259. The ETC Securities, Tranche 677, were issued on Monday, adding 229,200 units, each with a metal entitlement of 0.0396786 fine troy ounces as of the subscription trade date. The ETC Securities are part of a program designed to offer investors exposure to physical gold without the need to take physical delivery. These securities are linked to the price of gold and backed by physical gold held in custody. Amundi Physical Metals plc has structured the program to allow only authorized participants, such as banks and financial institutions, to subscribe directly to new issuances. The new securities have been admitted to trading on several major stock exchanges, including  Euronext  (EPA:ENX) Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Deutsche Börse, Borsa Italiana, and the  London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSEG). They are also traded on the International Quotation System of the Mexican Stock Exchange. This broad listing aims to provide liquidity and accessibility to investors across different markets. Investors should note that the total expense ratio for managing these ETC Securities is 0.12% per annum, which will be deducted from the metal entitlement associated with each security. The securities have a scheduled maturity date of May 23, 2118, and offer a nominal amount of USD 5.085 per ETC Security. The ETC Securities program by Amundi Physical Metals plc is part of a growing market for precious metal-linked investment products, which provide an alternative to investing directly in physical commodities. The issuer’s expansion of its gold ETC offerings reflects ongoing investor interest in gold as an investment asset. This information is based on a press release statement from Amundi Physical Metals plc, which outlines the final terms of the new tranche of ETC Securities issued under its secured precious metal linked ETC Securities Programme.
