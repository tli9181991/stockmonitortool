U.Today - Bitcoiner Samson Mow published a tweet, suggesting that even if top altcoins had a total coin supply similar to that of Bitcoin, BTC would still beat them in terms of price per coin. Mow stated that most altcoins are taking advantage of the so-called unit bias — a psychological effect that appears since, due to their huge supplies of billions and sometimes even trillions of coins, the price per coin seems cheaper than that of one BTC. If this bias is removed, he says, then mathematically, these altcoins should be worth several thousand of dollars each. But Mow doesn’t believe in these theoretical figures, saying that Bitcoin would still have a much higher market dominance.  For example, he shows, ETH: $193B market cap / 21M = $9,200. Most altcoins, Mow claims, take advantage of this unit bias “by utilizing a very high supply, so people can’t figure out what they’re buying.” Many believe that buying one XRP for $2, for example, is much cheaper than buying Bitcoin at $85,000, he says, adding that “unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated.” Finally, he said in reality there is “no way these alts are worth that much.”  But hardly anybody needs a unit for 10 Sats. Therefore, Mow suggests using this name to define one twenty-one millionth supply unit not only of Bitcoin but of each large altcoin and gold as well. Therefore, he says, “A Finney of Bitcoin = $85,000 (for now). A Finney of ETH = $9,200. A Finney of gold = $1,000,000.” Samson Mow asked the community to share what they think about this idea.
