Bitcoiner Michael Saylor Issues Bullish Call as BTC Tests $108,000
U.Today - Michael Saylor, a major Bitcoin supporter and the head of BTC-powered company Strategy, has taken to his official X account to comment on today’s BTC price surge to top the $108,000 level. Saylor published a tweet that contains an AI-generated image of himself wearing a suit with an orange tie (orange is the color associated with Bitcoin). He looks like a driver about to set off, and he invites everyone to jump in and go with him: “Get in the car,” the tweet stated after Bitcoin’s price soared.  This price jump happened several days after Saylor’s company, Strategy, announced a massive BTC accumulation — $749 million worth of digital gold (7,390 BTC). Now, the company holds a total of 576,230 Bitcoin. Also, in an unexpected development this week, Strategy, Saylor and two other top executives of the company faced a class action lawsuit from MSTR investors, who alleged that Saylor and his company had given them misleading statements about their Bitcoin investment strategy.  Kiyosaki believes this would happen because of the failed U.S. Treasuries auction on May 20, when the Federal Reserve was driven to buy $50 billion worth of U.S. bonds. This signifies growing investor distrust in the U.S. debt sustainability and, Kiyosaki stressed, signifies that hyperinflation is likely to arrive very soon. This would be the driver that will take gold to $25,000 per ounce, silver to $70 and help Bitcoin skyrocket to $500,000 or even $1,000,000.
