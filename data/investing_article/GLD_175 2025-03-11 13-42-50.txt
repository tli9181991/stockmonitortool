LONDON - Amundi Physical Metals plc has announced the issuance of 555,300 new ETC Securities, which are part of its Amundi Physical Gold ETC, under its Secured Precious Metal Linked ETC Securities Programme. This latest tranche, numbered 667, follows the issue of 54,903,359 ETC Securities since the series began on May 23, 2019. Each ETC Security is linked to a specific quantity of gold, providing investors with exposure to the metal without the need for physical delivery.

The initiative comes with a Total Expense Ratio of 0.12% per annum, offering a cost-effective solution for investors. The ETC Securities are secured by gold held by HSBC Bank plc, the custodian, on an allocated basis, ensuring each security corresponds to a particular amount of gold. The issuance of this tranche is set for March 12, 2025, with the securities scheduled to mature on May 23, 2118. The ETC Securities have been admitted to trading on various regulated markets, including  Euronext  (EPA:ENX) Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Deutsche BÃ¶rse, Borsa Italiana, and the  London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSEG), along with the International Quotation System of the Mexican Stock Exchange. Investors should note that the value of the ETC Securities can fluctuate based on gold price movements, and the performance of the metal in the future may not mirror past performance. The securities are subject to market perception, the creditworthiness of certain transaction parties, and the liquidity of the ETC Securities on the secondary market.
