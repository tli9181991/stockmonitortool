Investing.com-- Bitcoin rebounded on Friday, recovering some ground after getting battered by an escalating trade war stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff decisions, while investors were also cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting due next week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency added 4.6% to $84,519 by 2:04 p.m. ET (18:04 GMT) A broader risk-off sentiment prevailed following President Donald Trump’s recent threat to impose a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports.  This move was a retaliation against the European Union’s planned levies on American whiskey. Trump is further expected to impose worldwide reciprocal tariffs on April 2.  Developments around this escalating trade war have intensified fears of a potential U.S. recession, leading investors to retreat from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. This shift has prompted investors to move towards safer assets. Notably, gold prices surged to record highs on Friday, underscoring a broader risk-off sentiment among investors. Adding to the cautious market environment, investors are closely monitoring the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for March 18-19.  The Fed is widely expected to maintain its current interest rate policy, adopting a wait-and-see approach amid the prevailing economic uncertainties. The central bank’s stance is influenced by concerns that ongoing trade disputes could exacerbate inflationary pressures, further complicating the economic outlook.  Russia is increasingly using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters reported on Friday citing sources familiar with the matter.

While traditional currencies still dominate trade, crypto transactions have grown to tens of millions of dollars per month, the report said. The use of digital assets is expected to continue in Russia’s oil trade due to its efficiency and speed, the report noted. However, a Kremlin adviser emphasized that cryptocurrencies are just one of several methods being used to navigate payment restrictions.
