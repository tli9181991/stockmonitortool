U.Today - Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned investor and financial education advocate, also famous for authoring “Rich Dad Poor Dad” and other books on funds management and financial markets, has addressed his followers on the X platform to talk Bitcoin to them. In this tweet, Kiyosaki cited the former U.S. congressman Ron Paul and his negative attitude to central banks.  According to Kiyosaki, Ron Paul believes that central banks’ policy of setting interest rates and form central planning is “designed to steal your wealth, destroy production, steal our freedoms.” It is worth noting here that Ron Paul is also a renowned proponent of the world’s very first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But going back to Kiyosaki, he shared a piece of advice that he has recently repeated many times but in different forms: Do not save “fake money” (this is what he calls unbacked U.S. dollars) but invest in Bitcoin, silver and gold. And he does not mean ETFs or any similar tools, only direct ownership: “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.” He also says that Bitcoin can help you “fight back” against central banks.  Honda and Nissan are also cancelling their merge because of the trade tariffs implemented by U.S. president Donald Trump. Trade tariffs for China are the biggest and have reached 150% with China mirroring this tactic against U.S. goods. Kiyosaki advises that people prepare for a tremendous market crash coming soon and buy Bitcoin: “Regardless, gold, silver, and Bitcoin are still your defense in this global war caused by greed, insanity, and fear.” This article was originally published on U.Today ProPicks AI are 6 model portfolios created by Investing.com which identify the best stocks for investors to buy now.
