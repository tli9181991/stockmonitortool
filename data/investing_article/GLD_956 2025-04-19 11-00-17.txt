U.Today - Robert Kiyosaki, a prominent entrepreneur and the author of the book on personal finance management “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has published a stunning Bitcoin price prediction. He believes that BTC will exceed $1 million and explained why he expects it to happen. He also shared how even people with limited financial opportunities can emerge from the current massive market crash wealthy.  Overall, the financial expert expects that yet another Great (even Greater) Depression is coming to the country, and he reminded the community that he had predicted all that in his book “Rich Dad’s Prophecy,” which came out in the early 2000s. That book was about “the coming biggest stock market crash in history….that is here now.” Most of his books, Kiyosaki claims, contained warnings about a “coming financial disaster.”  Kiyosaki believes it may be enough to get just a fraction of Bitcoin or half of one BTC to become wealthy when the current crisis is over. When will it happen? The expert said he strongly believes that by 2035, the BTC price will exceed $1 million, and gold and silver will be worth $30,000 per ounce and $3,000 per coin. “It will be the easiest money you ever made,” Kiyosaki says. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $84,967, having shown a 2% increase since Wednesday. This week, BTC has been moving along this price line, failing any attempts to rise higher so far. It has recovered after the crash faced after Jerome Powell’s statement published Wednesday. This article was originally published on U.Today AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
