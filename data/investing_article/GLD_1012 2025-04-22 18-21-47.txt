(Reuters) -Canada’s Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is looking to sell its last mine in the country in a push to capitalize on record gold prices and a renewed interest in North American mining operations, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Earlier on Tuesday, the gold miner said it will exit the Donlin gold Project in Alaska by selling its 50% stake to billionaire John Paulson and NovaGold Resources for up to $1.1 billion.  Barrick began a process in April to sell its Hemlo gold mine in Ontario, Canada, and retained  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  (NYSE:CM) to find buyers and solicit bids, the report said. Barrick Gold and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
