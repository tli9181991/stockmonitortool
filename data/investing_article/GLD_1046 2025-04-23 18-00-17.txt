U.Today - Adam Back, the CEO and founder of Blockstream, cypherpunk and the person mentioned in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper, has commented on the overall situation in the cryptocurrency market and the near future of BTC at the same time.  He also agreed with Hougan that after $100,000, Bitcoin’s price will start to rally harder. The Bitwise CEO explained the current Bitcoin price surge — it has happened because of the current state of the economy, which is poor: “Bitcoin is rallying because they broke the economy.” Once the U.S. government begins to “fix the economy,” Bitcoin will start rallying harder, he believes. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin spiked by 6.5%, rallying from $88,590 to the $94,355 level. By now, a small rebound has taken BTC down to $93,650.  This year, the gold price has been rallying hard and reached a new all-time high twice, the most recent one occurred this Monday, when gold hit $3,500 per troy ounce. Tom Lee said that he believes Bitcoin can start catching up to gold, which likely means it may reach a new all-time high. He said there is a lot of room for Bitcoin to catch up with gold.
