This measure affects a broad range of products, from industrial machinery components to everyday items like soda cans.  Prior to the enforcement, Trump briefly proposed increasing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%. This escalation was in reaction to Ontario’s new trade restrictions.  However, after discussions between Ontario Premier Doug Ford and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S. Consequently, the Trump administration retracted the proposed 50% tariff increase, maintaining the existing 25% rate.  The implementation of these tariffs has sparked concerns about a potential economic slowdown, supporting gold prices due to its safe-haven appeal The US Dollar Index inched 0.2% higher in Asia hours, but remained near a four-month touched last week.
