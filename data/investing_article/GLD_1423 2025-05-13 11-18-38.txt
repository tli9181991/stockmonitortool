  International Game Technology (NYSE:IGT) presented its first quarter 2025 results on May 13, highlighting the resilience of its lottery business despite facing headwinds from lower multi-state jackpot activity in the United States. The company, which is in the process of divesting its Gaming & Digital segment, demonstrated the underlying strength of its core lottery operations while positioning itself for future growth opportunities. The presentation revealed that while overall revenue and profit metrics declined year-over-year, the company’s lottery business maintained solid performance when normalized for calendar shifts and jackpot impacts. Management emphasized the historical resilience of lottery sales during economic uncertainty, a trend supported by data spanning multiple recessions.   IGT reported Q1 2025 revenue of $583 million, down from $661 million in the same period last year. Operating income decreased to $138 million from $219 million, while Adjusted EBITDA fell to $250 million from $327 million in Q1 2024. The company attributed these declines primarily to lower U.S. multi-state jackpot activity and associated LMA (Lottery Management Agreement) incentives. Despite these challenges, the company highlighted several positive trends. Global instant ticket and draw game same-store sales increased by 1.4% when normalized for calendar shifts, demonstrating sustained player demand for core lottery products. As shown in the following chart detailing same-store sales performance across regions:  Particularly impressive was the performance of IGT’s iLottery segment, which saw wagers increase by more than 25% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth across all geographic regions. This digital growth represents a significant opportunity for the company as it focuses on its lottery business. The company’s profit structure demonstrated resilience despite revenue challenges, as illustrated in this financial performance slide:    IGT outlined four key areas of strategic focus to drive sustainable long-term growth. These include product innovation, expanding retail touch points and point-of-sale network optimization, growing instant ticket services, and increasing iLottery adoption.
