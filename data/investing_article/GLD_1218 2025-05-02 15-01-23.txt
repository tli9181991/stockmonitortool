Global high-yield bond funds saw a net $3.58 billion in inflows, after five straight weeks of net selling. Global short-term bond funds witnessed net purchases of $1.56 billion. But global money market funds saw net sales of $26.06 billion after witnessing about $15.26 billion worth of net inflows during the previous week.
