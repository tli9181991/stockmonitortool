(Reuters) - The Trump administration’s on again, off again approach to tariffs has whipsawed global markets, prompting investors to seek shelter in safe haven assets such as gold. At the same time, the raging trade war with China and the possibility of a U.S. recession have spurred talks of overseas investors reducing their dollar and U.S. debt positions - also considered traditional hedges against market turmoil. Here’s a look at major economies/central banks and their holdings of gold and Treasuries in recent months:  GOLD Sustained demand from central banks has created a reliable floor under gold prices, supporting bullion’s historic rally this year. [GOL/] Spot gold prices surged as high as $3,500.05 per ounce on Tuesday, surpassing the $3,500/oz milestone for the first time. [GOL/] "With all the geopolitical tensions, central banks do want to diversify away from the dollar and have something that won’t be sanctioned ... gold is one of those asset classes that could fit the bill," Marex analyst Edward Meir said. The following is a table of gold holdings of major central banks: All figures are in tonnes.   December January February 2025  2024 2025  United States 8133.71 8131.98 8133.75  Germany 3351.63 3351.06 3351.79  Italy    2451.91 2451.91 2451.94  France 2437.08 2436.48 2437.01  Russia - - -  China 2279.13 2284.12 *2289.08  Switzerland 1039.97 1036.79 1040.12  India 876.20 878.81 879.00  Japan 846.00 846.00 846.03  Netherlands 612.47 612.31 612.44  * China’s central bank gold holding as of the end of March 2025 is 2292.38 tonnes.

Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose 3.4% to $8.817 trillion in February, data from the Treasury Department showed. "When you have an excess amount of money, like all these entities do, you have to do something with that money. And what they would do was buy debt, buy Treasury," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments. "But when you have a trade war going on, the dynamic changes. I can almost guarantee you that data can be much different."
