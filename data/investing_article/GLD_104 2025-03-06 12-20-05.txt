(Reuters) - Futures tied to Canada’s main stock index declined on Thursday as trade tensions lingered despite some reprieve on U.S. tariffs. The futures on the S&P/TSX index were down 1% at 6:30 a.m. ET (1130 GMT). The S&P/TSX composite index recorded a strong rally in the previous session, closing 1.2% higher. U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday exempted automakers from his stringent tariffs on Canada and Mexico for one month, as long as the companies complied with the terms of an existing free-trade agreement. However, Trump made it clear that he was not calling off his 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, pressing the two countries to deter fentanyl smuggling. Oil prices were steady on Thursday, recovering slightly from a multi-year low. Brent was below $70, still pressured by the ongoing trade tensions and OPEC+’s plans to raise output. Gold prices fell as investors took profits following a three-day rally. Copper prices hit a near three-week high, helped by a sharp pullback in the U.S. dollar and hopes for more stimulus from top consumer China.
