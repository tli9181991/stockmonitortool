Investing.com -- A reserve currency earns its role not just through economic size, but by offering trust, liquidity and institutional acceptance.  While UBS Global Research does not directly define reserve currency characteristics, its analysis of precious metals highlights many of the traits investors look for in a store of value, traits that parallel those of a reserve currency. In a market gripped by uncertainty, gold remains the asset of choice. UBS notes that gold benefits from official sector support, something that silver, platinum and palladium lack. This backing reinforces gold’s position as a trusted reserve asset, particularly during geopolitical and economic stress. Investor behavior confirms this trend. While gold ETFs have posted gains this year, silver ETF holdings have been flat.  UBS flags that investor caution toward silver, despite tight supply, stems from the absence of institutional demand and persistent doubts about industrial growth.  In contrast, gold continues to draw consistent flows, reflecting a preference for assets with deep liquidity and a track record of performance under pressure. The brokerage also notes that white metals remain in structural supply deficits. However, that tightness has not translated into sustained investor demand.  UBS points out that investors have been reluctant to use silver or platinum as substitutes for gold, reinforcing the idea that institutional trust and policy relevance matter more than market conditions alone. Platinum and palladium also fall short of reserve asset characteristics. Platinum lacks a clear demand catalyst, and palladium’s fortunes are tied too closely to the auto sector.  UBS acknowledges some upside risk tied to supply constraints, but neither metal has drawn significant investor flows.  Thin liquidity and market sensitivity make them unsuitable as reserve assets, even if prices rise in the short term. UBS’s commentary ultimately underscores that what makes a reserve currency, or a reserve asset, is not price outlook or supply-demand balance alone. Rather, it’s consistent demand, official sector endorsement, and investor confidence that define lasting value. Gold demonstrates those qualities today. White metals, for all their industrial uses and tight supply, do not. AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
