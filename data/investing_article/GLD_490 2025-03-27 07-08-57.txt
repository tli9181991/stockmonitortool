LONDON - Kepler Trust Intelligence, an investment research provider, has released a new report suggesting that gold mining companies remain undervalued even after a recent surge in prices. The analysis, focusing on the sectorâ€™s financial health and market positioning, was made available to UK investors on Thursday. The report, issued by Kepler Partners LLP, highlights that despite the strong performance of gold miners in the market, their valuations do not fully reflect the rally.
