U.Today - Mike McGlone, the chief commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has published a tweet about gold, Bitcoin and other commodities and their behavior under the current U.S. austerity regarding its external economic policy. While stating that gold is rising, surpassing everything else, including Bitcoin, the expert believes that the world’s largest cryptocurrency may experience a major crash this year since it is moving in line with the Nasdaq 100 index.  Now, Bloomberg’s expert said, “gold is shining” versus crude oil, the stock market (the S&P 500 index) and Bitcoin. This is likely to have deflationary implications if the situation remains this way. The current situation with the U.S. imposing austerity and high tariffs on its closest neighbours – Mexico, Canada – and China may provide catalysts for “some overdue reversion in risk assets,” McGlone stated.  Thus, McGlone might be hinting at a bubble forming now and that it may burst, pushing Bitcoin down this year, when it potentially reaches $100,000 per coin once again. A collapse of 80% from $100,000 would constitute $20,000. However, this is a price that nobody in the crypto market believes Bitcoin would ever fall to again. Today, digital gold (Bitcoin) has printed a rise of 4.75% and is currently changing hands at $89,475, still unable to hold above the $90,000 level.
