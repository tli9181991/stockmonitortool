By Alden Bentley NEW YORK (Reuters) - Making sense of the forces driving global markets Jamie is enjoying some well-deserved time off, but the Reuters markets team will still keep you up to date on what moved markets today.  Today’s Key Market Moves * The S&P 500 ends up 0.55% at 5,611.51 * The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield falls 3.3 basispoints to 4.222% * The euro falls 0.12% against the dollar to $1.0814 * The dollar rises 0.1% against the yen to 149.93 yen * Gold bullion rises 1.29% to $3,123.92 an ounce Wall Street shakes off tariff trepidation Investors’ aversion to uncertainty was the theme across global markets on Monday in the run-up to U.S. President Donald Trump’s promised April 2 "Liberation Day" tariff announcements. After sharp share falls in Asia and Europe, the risk-off contagion hit Wall Street in early trade, while safe-haven Treasuries were bought and gold topped $3,100 an ounce for the first time. However, the S&P 500 and the Dow clawed their way back into the green even as Treasury yields stayed slightly lower on the day amid worries about how Trump’s trade war will impact U.S. and overseas growth. Goldman Sachs increased the probability of a U.S. recession this year to 35%, also lowering its U.S. GDP growth forecast and year-end target for the S&P 500, establishing itself as the most bearish big firm so far. Month-end and quarter-end adjustments were also afoot, so the choppiness was not a surprise.
