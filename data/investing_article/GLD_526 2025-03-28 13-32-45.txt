(Reuters) - Global equity funds attracted large inflows in the week through March 26 when equity markets initially rebounded on optimism that President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration would apply tariffs more selectively rather than impose broad trade restrictions. Investors purchased global equity funds of a net $35.43 billion during the week following about $29.49 billion worth of net sales in the prior week, data from LSEG Lipper showed. The MSCI World Index recovered as much as 4.26% after hitting a six-month low of 819.94 on March 13, reaching a two-and-a-half-week high of 854.88 on Tuesday. However, global equities turned slightly lower later in the week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 25% import tax on foreign-made vehicles and auto parts on Wednesday, rekindling investor concerns over a potential full-scale trade war. U.S. equity funds recorded net weekly inflows of $22.44 billion, reversing sharply from net outflows of $33.53 billion the previous week. European and Asian equity funds also attracted strong investor interest, with net inflows of $6.84 billion and $4.36 billion, respectively. Technology led the sectors with $1.32 billion in inflows, followed by financials and industrials at $802 million and $754 million, respectively. Global bond funds registered net purchases of $1.37 billion, rebounding from net sales of $255 million in the prior week. Euro-denominated bond funds recorded their fourth consecutive week of inflows, totaling $1.28 billion, while short-term debt funds attracted $791 million. Meanwhile, money market funds saw net outflows of $48.73 billion, extending losses for a third straight week. Commodity funds focused on gold and precious metals drew $3.03 billion - their highest weekly inflow in four weeks - amid heightened demand. Wei Li, head of multi-asset investments at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management, attributed the surge in gold ETF inflows to increased demand from institutional investors.  "Institutional investors often take a strategic approach to asset allocation, using gold to hedge against market volatility and economic downturns," Li said. Data from 29,634 emerging market funds showed equity outflows easing to a three-week low of $163 million, while bond funds posted $448 million in net outflows, marking the second consecutive week of redemptions.
