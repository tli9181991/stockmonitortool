Investing.com -- U.S. equity funds recorded their first inflow in five weeks, while money market funds saw sizable outflows, suggesting a risk-on shift among investors. According to Bank of America, global stock funds pulled in $25.2 billion in the week to May 14, while bond funds attracted $13.1 billion and crypto funds saw $900 million in inflows. In contrast, $400 million exited gold funds, and $17.5 billion left cash. Flows into credit were particularly strong, with investment grade and high-yield bonds drawing a combined $8.6 billion—the largest in 10 weeks. Emerging market debt also saw its biggest inflow since January 2023 at $1.5 billion. Sector-wise, financial stocks received $1 billion, marking their first inflow in seven weeks. Within U.S. equities, large caps dominated with $18.2 billion in inflows, placing them on track for a record $521 billion in 2025. Small caps, despite $0.6 billion in weekly inflows, remain on course for a record $68 billion outflow this year. Real estate stocks are likewise facing a record $25 billion in annual outflows. On the other hand, gold is heading for a record $85 billion inflow year-to-date. Strategists led by Michael Hartnett warned that global equity markets are nearing overbought conditions. “Currently 84% of MSCI indices are trading above 50dma/200dma,” the team noted. The team points to its Global Breadth Rule, which advises selling when over 88% of indices exceed both moving averages. “A good ‘fade-the-rip’ reminder,” they added. Hartnett highlighted three key market levels currently guiding investor sentiment: the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield at 5%, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) at 100, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) at 5000. In what they call the “Tale of the Tape,” the team cautions that another bout of rising yields and a weaker dollar—potentially triggered if U.S. President Donald Trump “loses the long-end”—could spark a stock sell-off. Still, they believe the 30-year Treasury yield will hold the 5% level “for now.” Hartnett compared the current macro setup to the early 1970s, a period marked by geopolitical shifts, fiscal experimentation, and highly selective equity performance. “Despite great tech advances, the macro & markets in early ‘70s were all ‘boom & bust,’ ‘stop & go’,” he wrote, adding that today’s “Magnificent 7” tech stocks are mirroring the outperformance of the “Nifty Fifty” back then. In fixed income, inflows were broad-based in the past week. Investment grade bonds took in $4.9 billion and high-yield bonds $3.6 billion, both posting their third consecutive week of gains. EM debt extended its inflow streak to four weeks, while municipal bond funds added $800 million. Treasury funds, however, saw $700 million in renewed outflows. Regionally, U.S. equity funds led with $19.8 billion in inflows, followed by Europe with $2.7 billion and Japan with $800 million. Emerging market stocks recorded a third week of outflows, totaling $3.3 billion. AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
