LONDON - Amundi Physical Metals plc has announced the issuance of a new tranche of its gold-linked Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETC), marking another addition to its growing suite of metal-backed financial instruments. The latest tranche, numbered 673, consists of 86,700 ETC Securities under the Amundi Physical Gold ETC, which will be available from Thursday, March 27, 2025. The ETC Securities, each initially representing 0.04 fine troy ounces of gold, provide investors with exposure to the metal without the necessity of physical delivery. This issuance follows Amundi’s secured precious metal linked ETC Securities Programme, aligning with the company’s strategy to offer investment solutions tied to the price of precious metals. Amundi has confirmed that the total number of ETC Securities of the series, immediately following the issue, will be 57,493,559. The ETC Securities have been admitted to trading on multiple platforms, including  Euronext  (EPA:ENX) Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, the Deutsche Börse, Borsa Italiana, and the  London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSEG). Furthermore, they are also traded on the International Quotation System of the Mexican Stock Exchange, with applications for additional listings possible in the future. Investors should note the Total Expense Ratio for the ETC Securities stands at 0.12% per annum, which will impact the metal entitlement associated with each security over time. The ETC Securities are designed to track the gold price, subject to fees and expenses as outlined in the final terms. The ETC Securities are part of a broader offering aimed at providing investors with a means to gain exposure to gold prices. The issuance is based on a base prospectus approved by the United  Kingdom  (TADAWUL:4280) Financial Conduct Authority, which has been supplemented to reflect the current terms. Amundi Physical Metals plc emphasizes that the ETC Securities are secured, limited recourse obligations, with the rights of security holders limited to the secured property, in this case, gold. The ETC Securities rank equally among themselves and with respect to the issuer’s capital structure in the event of insolvency. This announcement is based on a press release statement and investors are advised to review the full documentation, including the base prospectus, final terms, and supplements, when considering an investment in the ETC Securities.
