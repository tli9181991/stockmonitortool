Investing.com -- As tensions between the United States and China continue to escalate, global financial advisory giant, deVere Group, predicts that gold prices could surge to $5,000 an ounce. This analysis from CEO Nigel Green comes as the precious metal’s value continues to rally aggressively, recently breaching fresh all-time highs above $3,450 during Asian trading on Tuesday. The global investment community is bracing for what could become a prolonged, entrenched economic war between the world’s two largest economies, intensifying the momentum of the gold rally. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, states that the world is watching a strategic decoupling of these economies in real time, with implications that stretch far beyond trade. Green believes that in this environment, gold is becoming the ultimate financial insurance. Investors are rapidly repositioning as the US-China standoff deepens with increasing tariffs, expanding technology restrictions, and fragmenting capital markets. As the risk of a full decoupling grows, so does the demand for gold. Green explains that capital seeks clarity, which is currently lacking due to the competing economic and ideological interests of the US and China. This competition is driving a seismic shift in portfolio strategy. The US dollar, traditionally seen as the global safe haven, is losing its footing as tensions rise. The more strained the relationship between Washington and Beijing becomes, the less confidence investors have in the dollar, and the more appealing dollar-denominated assets like gold become. Political uncertainty within the US is also amplifying the gold rush. Reports that the Trump administration considered ways to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have rattled global markets. When the independence of central banks is called into question, the implications for inflation, interest rates and currency stability become unpredictable. This uncertainty is driving investors to seek shelter in gold. Gold, long considered a traditional store of value in times of upheaval, is once again proving its strategic relevance as a core allocation. Inflation risks are no longer viewed solely through the lens of economic cycles, but also through the lens of massive state-driven industrial strategies and supply chain protectionism implemented by Washington and Beijing. This is structurally fueling inflation, leading to higher structural inflation, weaker currencies, and a renewed focus on hard assets, with gold at the center. The current surge in gold prices is not a speculative spike, but a repricing of risk. deVere Group believes the next phase could be even more dramatic if US-China relations deteriorate further. Should Washington and Beijing continue to double down instead of de-escalating, significant inflows into gold are expected to continue as investors seek safety in a more fractured world.
