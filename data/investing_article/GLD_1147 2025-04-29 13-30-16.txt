U.Today - Prominent investor and the founder of Gold Bullion International, Dan Tapiero, has published a chart showing a drastic increase in gold trading activity in China. The source of this chart is Bloomberg. He believes that Bitcoin is likely to blossom in the United States.  This coincides with the data published in the recent World Gold Council’s report, which indicates the continuation of the retail investment boom in gold in China. Specifically, this report says that in Q1, 2024, the demand for gold in the second-largest global economy could be estimated as 336 tons (down 36% year-over-year). Still, the gold price spike drove a boom in gold investment demand even though the jewelry demand became weaker. Besides, Chinese gold ETFs saw strong inflows in 2024, and they had a great impact on gold trading activity in the country. At the start of 2025, the demand for gold surged in the U.S. and the rest of the world due to the economic uncertainty caused by the actions of newly elected U.S. President Donald Trump — mostly trade tariffs. The U.S. raised tariffs the highest against Chinese products — 145% — and the latter did likewise. In early April, gold reached its second consecutive all-time high this year, hitting $3,500 per ounce.  Tapiero believes that this could mean Bitcoin is still at a very early stage because of the situation in China and Europe (which is also hostile toward BTC, he stresses). This makes the U.S. “only one beacon of freedom” and the “crypto capital of the world.” This article was originally published on U.Today AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
