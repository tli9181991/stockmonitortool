U.Today - John D’Agostino, the Head of Strategy at Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Institutional, appeared in CNBC’s Squawk Box show to discuss Bitcoin and institutions buying it recently. VC investor Anthony Pompliano published a post about that on X. Pompliano was excited about what D’Agostino said about large institutional players accumulating Bitcoin. He commented that this “would have been unfathomable just 2-3 years ago.”  Commenting on the factors that are currently driving the Bitcoin price upward, D’Agostino first talked about the decoupling of Bitcoin and the stock market. He referred to it as a negative and positive correlation of BTC and stocks. A negative one happens when the market is panicking, the executive said, and a positive one when the market is blooming. Nobody minds a positive correlation, he stated. As for the current drivers of Bitcoin growth, D’Agostino made it clear that the situation they are looking at is a short-term one, and everything may change next month, for instance. Besides, he said that a similar set of tailwinds in another period of time could trigger a different reaction from Bitcoin than it is showing now. That also applies to gold and any other asset on the market.  Those financial institutions, like sovereign wealth funds, large insurance pools, etc., have been buying Bitcoin and then selling it for fiat when they need it. But if they believe that the dollar is going to weaken, then they stop converting BTC to fiat, and they just keep buying Bitcoin to hold it. D’Agostino also mentioned that many traders now believe that Bitcoin is one of the few assets that mirrors the characteristics of gold and start buying it when markets become unstable.
