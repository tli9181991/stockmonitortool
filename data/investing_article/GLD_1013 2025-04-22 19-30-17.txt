U.Today - Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has drawn the community’s attention to the fact that recently the stock market has been plummeting, while the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has been on a rise, heading to test the $90,000 price level.  Balchunas also mentioned gold, which is “in the leage of own.” On Monday, it showed a small decline of 0.983, displaying a strong negative correlation to the stock market. However, today, this precious metal soared to a new all-time high at $3,500 per troy ounce after U.S. President Donald Trump has confirmed his intention to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell.  Brandt shared a chart, showing that gold has been heavily declining against the S&P 500 since its previous all-time high in 2012. This year, the gold price has been rising steeply with XAU, reaching 23% YTD growth by now. Peter Brandt stated that gold might be oversold versus stocks in the near term, but as for the long-term prospects, “We’ve only just begun the flippening.” This article was originally published on U.Today AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
