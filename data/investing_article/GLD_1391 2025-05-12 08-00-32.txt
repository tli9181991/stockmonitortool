 Castries, Saint Lucia, May 12th, 2025, Chainwire PrimeXBT, a regulated multi-asset broker, has announced the launch of its VIP Tiers, a trading-based rewards system designed to lower trading costs for high-volume traders. With discounts of up to 50% now available, the new system brings enhanced flexibility and cost efficiency to trading across a wide range of markets. VIP Tiers are applied automatically based on a trader’s 30-day cumulative trading volume across Crypto Futures, Forex, and CFDs on Indices, Commodities, Stocks, and Crypto. Traders who reach the volume milestone for VIP Tier 1 are instantly upgraded, unlocking a 25% discount on Crypto Futures and CFD trading costs. The tier status remains locked for 30 days but can still be upgraded to VIP Tier 2, offering a 40% discount on Crypto Futures and a 50% discount on CFD trading costs, once the trading volume criteria is met. According to PrimeXBT, the introduction of VIP Tiers gives traders a clear and motivating way to lower trading costs the more they trade. The tier system is designed to be accessible for active retail traders while also catering to institutional participants across diverse markets. The broker views this launch as a major step toward creating a more inclusive and rewarding environment for high-volume traders of all kinds.
