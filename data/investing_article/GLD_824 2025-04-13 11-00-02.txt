Investing.com -- The intensifying trade conflict between the United States and China is no longer just an economic standoff.  According to BCA Research, the tariff war is now a key geopolitical flashpoint that could contribute to a broader military confrontation, particularly over Taiwan. In response to President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, Beijing has retaliated with an 84% tariff and a sharp depreciation of the renminbi.  The economic fallout from these actions is mounting. But Trump’s broader strategy reveals a more calculated approach: while pushing aggressively on China, he has paused tariffs on other countries to avoid triggering a recession and a deeper stock market correction. The S&P 500 has hovered near bear market territory, and BCA notes that Trump appears wary of crossing that threshold.  His recent move to de-escalate trade tensions globally, except with China, suggests an effort to maintain economic stability while applying targeted pressure on a primary strategic rival. BCA identifies two scenarios that could lead to an intensification of the crisis. In one, Trump resumes global tariffs if he believes a recession is inevitable anyway. In the other, the administration anticipates a major geopolitical shock, such as failed Iran negotiations or escalating tensions in East Asia, and uses trade policy as a preemptive or diversionary tool. The most concerning scenario remains a spillover of the trade war into a strategic or military confrontation. BCA assigns a 30% probability of a Taiwan-related military escalation this year, including a 5% chance of a broader global conflict. If Beijing concludes that trade talks are futile and that the U.S. intends to keep barriers in place permanently, it may forgo diplomacy and act more assertively in the region. China is expected to inject about three trillion RMB in fiscal stimulus, roughly 3% to 4% of GDP. However, BCA warns that if this stimulus does not double to 6% to 10%, it could signal that Beijing is planning to apply hybrid pressure on Taiwan rather than relying solely on economic tools to stabilize its economy. The brokerage stresses that China could repeat its 2019 playbook—engaging in trade negotiations as a cover while preparing actions on Taiwan.  Alternatively, if economic pressure builds too quickly, China might skip diplomacy and move sooner. Given this outlook, BCA advises investors to favor safe-haven assets, defensive stocks, government bonds, and precious metals. While there may be a short-term rally in markets outside the U.S. and China, continued geopolitical and economic stress is expected to suppress long-term risk appetite. In BCA’s view, the trade war is a conduit for broader geopolitical instability. If economic pressure continues unchecked, it risks triggering the very strategic confrontation both countries say they want to avoid AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
