Bitcoin on Verge of New ATH as It Reaches Greed Zone
U.Today - The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index that tracks the state of investor sentiment on the Bitcoin market now displays 70, which is in the “greed” zone. It happened as the world’s flagship cryptocurrency reached the $108,007 level earlier today, standing very close to the $109,100 historic peak reached on Jan. 20. Currently BTC is changing hands at $106,163 per coin after shedding 1.74% today.  Still, on-chain data sources, and Sentora among them, expect that Bitcoin is about to surpass the January all-time high and set a new one — perhaps even later today. The tweet published by this data source also points out that 99% of Bitcoin holders are currently in profit. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been absorbing large inflows recently, particularly when it came to spot Bitcoin ETFs. As reported by U.Today, Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive $329 million go into them on Tuesday as the BTC price jumped 3.39%, adding almost $2,000 in a single day.  Kiyosaki referred to a statement made by JP Morgan years ago, claiming that “Gold is money…everything else is toilet paper.” Agreeing with this, Kiyosaki adds Bitcoin and silver to gold, calling even the now-popular spot Bitcoin ETFs “toilet paper” too. He pointed out that after Moody’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating, central banks began selling U.S. bonds to buy gold. Kiyosaki advises stacking BTC, gold and silver to overcome the hard economic recession he expects to hit the U.S. soon.
