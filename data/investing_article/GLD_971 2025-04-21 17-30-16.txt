U.Today - Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent range play resolved bullishly early Monday, shifting focus to $90,000, which had previously been a strong support level. Bitcoin’s price soared beyond $87,000, breaking out of a weeklong consolidation range of $83,000 to $86,000. The bulls’ renewed readiness to lead the price movement suggests that a major recovery of Bitcoin might be underway. According to on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin’s recent price action suggests the potential for a continued move higher to the $90,000 mark. The $90,000-$92,000 range served as the floor for Bitcoin prices from December to early February. The support zone was eventually breached in late February, resulting in a fall to below $75,000 in April. According to IntoTheBlock, the cost-basis indicator clusters reveal little overhead supply below the $90,000 range, implying the market could advance quickly before a larger tranche of holders reaches break-even and begins taking profit.  As a result, the $90,000 mark is the initial next target. To reach this price level, Bitcoin might need to break decisively above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $88,245. The bullish forecast risks being invalidated if prices fall all the way down to $85,000, with Bitcoin potentially remaining in its previous trading range. Eyes will be on the daily SMA 50 at $84,066 to see if Bitcoin confirms it as support. This article was originally published on U.Today AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
