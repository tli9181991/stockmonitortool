U.Today - Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has shared his new take on the course crypto prices may take this year. Notably, the viewpoint he expressed this time is quite opposite to the ultra-bearish Bitcoin price outlook he shared several times earlier this year.  Those countries are responding with similar measures. Mike McGlone believes that this means a new turn for risk assets, and particularly for cryptocurrencies that he believes to be highly speculative and volatile. “Cryptocurrencies are likely to continue leading the way,” he stated. He also predicted a further rise of gold, which scored a new all-time high of $3,115 per ounce earlier this week: “Gold $3,000 an ounce resistance may be transitioning to support.” Earlier this year, McGlone predicted that Bitcoin was likely to shed a zero from the $100,000 level reached in January and crash as low as $10,000 per coin, comparing BTC to the dot-com bubble that resulted in the burst of the Nasdaq tech index back in 2000. He also pointed out that investors had begun to withdraw their funds from spot Bitcoin ETFs and push them into gold-backed exchange-traded funds.  Kiyosaki believes that demand for silver is going to surge; therefore, he expects it to go up 2x this year and hit at least $70 per ounce. He called it the best asset of the three — Bitcoin, gold and silver — for the next two months. Over the next two years, Kiyosaki believes, silver is likely to reach a new all-time high. Still, he continues to recommend saving all three — gold, silver and Bitcoin. This article was originally published on U.Today AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
