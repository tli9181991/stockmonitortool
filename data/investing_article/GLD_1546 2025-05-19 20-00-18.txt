U.Today - Max Keiser, Bitcoin adviser to President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele, has taken to his account on the social media platform X to publish both a major warning and a BTC price prediction in one X post. Due to certain events looming on the horizon, Max Keiser expects Bitcoin to jump to the seven-figure price level.  The tweet calls this a “ major inflection point” not only for Japan but for the whole world, adding that the majority of people have no idea what this means. Keiser commented on this, calling the situation in Japan “a slow motion train wreck” that is about to “finally bust.” He also mentions the “Yen Carry Trade” with its flow of capital from Japan into the U.S. bond market. He stated that this strategy has “provided liquidity to keep 2 quadrillion worth of derivatives afloat,” and now it is collapsing. Max Keiser predicts that this global crash of bond markets (the bondpocalypse as he referred to it) is “ushering in Depression 2.0”. Keiser believes that Bitcoin, being the ultimate safe haven, is bound to reach $2,200,000 as global economic conditions are worsening.  Kiyosaki said that he keeps holding his Bitcoin and is buying more of it, urging his army of X followers to do likewise. As for the price prediction, the financial guru expects the digital gold to go as high as $250,000 this year. In a Sunday tweet that followed, Kiyosaki urged the community to avoid buying Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and focus on accumulating Bitcoin directly, as well as gold and silver. He believes these three to be real assets, and he continues to advocate for them. This article was originally published on U.Today AI computing powers are changing the stock market.
