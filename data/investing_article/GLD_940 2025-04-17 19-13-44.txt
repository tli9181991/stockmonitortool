(Reuters) - Citi Research raised its gold price target for the next three months to $3,500 per ounce from $3,200, led by fresh buying from Chinese insurers and safe-haven flows amid tariff risks and market weakness, it said in a note on Thursday. China’s recent move to let 10 insurers allocate up to 1% of their total assets to gold could generate annual demand of around 255 tonnes, equal to roughly a quarter of total global central bank buying, Citi said. Gold prices fell over 1% on Thursday after hitting record high of $3,357.40 earlier in the session, as investors booked profits ahead of a long weekend. However, a softer dollar and escalating U.S.-China trade tensions kept bullion above the $3,300 per ounce level.
