WASHINGTON - In a significant policy shift, the U.S. government has officially categorized gold as a strategic mineral. This development comes as President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on March 20, 2025, aimed at bolstering American mineral production. The Executive Order, "Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production," lists gold among several minerals deemed critical to national interests. This new classification underscores the importance of domestic gold resources for economic security and strategic resilience. Lexington Gold Ltd (AIM: LEX | OTCQB: LEXLF), a gold exploration and development company with projects in the United States and South Africa, acknowledged the Executive Order, viewing it as a positive step that could benefit their operations, particularly in the Carolinas. The federal directive calls for an acceleration of the permitting and regulatory processes for mineral projects considered a priority. This could potentially aid Lexington Gold’s exploration efforts, allowing for a more efficient advancement of its workstreams within a supportive policy framework. Additionally, the Executive Order opens up possibilities for government support, including access to funding and investment incentives. Lexington Gold is actively evaluating these potential advantages in relation to its current and planned project development activities. The U.S. initiative to strengthen domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on foreign mineral imports aligns with Lexington Gold’s mission to develop gold assets responsibly within the country. Bernard Olivier, CEO of Lexington Gold, expressed optimism regarding the Executive Order, stating that it reflects the recognition of gold’s role in financial security and industrial resilience. The company plans to engage with U.S. agencies to explore how its operations can align with the initiatives outlined in the Executive Order. Lexington Gold reiterated its commitment to responsible exploration, community engagement, and sustainable value creation for stakeholders.
