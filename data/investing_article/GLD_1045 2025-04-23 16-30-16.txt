U.Today - Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, has stressed his recent bearish forecasts for Bitcoin, adding Dogecoin to it as well this time. The expert believes that despite the current state of things for Bitcoin and Dogecoin seems to be fine as the trendline is holding the support, it will eventually get breached, pushing the crypto market down.  Bloomberg’s strategist stated that choosing between what is to happen next on this chart, a bear market bounce or a new bull run, he reckons it will be the former. “The Bitcoin/gold cross and Dogecoin have same-chart syndrome,” he said. Despite the trendline support still holding well, he said he eventually expects it to break down since currently the stock market is plunging, entering the recession that was prepared to but never arrived in 2023. Here McGlone stressed his expert take that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are strongly correlated with the stock market and its leading indexes — S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones.  Besides, spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a staggering netflow of $912.7 million in a single day for the first time since January.  He expects it to skyrocket 2x — to $70 — this year after it surpassed its old all-time high of $35 per ounce.
